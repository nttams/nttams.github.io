## Reverse proxy [work project]
- TBU
- [Large maps are bad for Go GC](https://nttams.github.io/large-maps-are-bad-for-go-gc.html)

## Weather targeting [work project]
- Convertion between locations configs (country/region codes, polygons, ...) to H3 cells: TBU
- [Real-time augmentation](https://nttams.github.io/weather-augmentation.html)


## Optimize C++ application performance
Identify and resolve bottleneck in C++ real-time engine, by moving expensive computations from single message passing thread to multiple worker threads.   
Result: **36-core -> 16-core for 50 instances (or 1800 cores -> 800 cores)**

TBU: will write more about this later
